This was a beginner project to refresh myself on GUI's, methods, etc in the python language. 
The actual code is very unorganized and uncommented due to it being mostly a warm up to programming again
My next project most likely will be transforming that ugly code into a more streamlined and easier to read format

I also wish to add the ability to add voters to the registry and to search by more than social
